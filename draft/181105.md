1. Laravel Passport Key path oauth-public.key does not exist or is not readable

You do not mention your installation steps. Presume you did the following:

```
composer require laravel/passport
```

Register the service provider inside `config/app.php`

Laravel\Passport\PassportServiceProvider::class,

Run the migrations

```
php artisan migrate
```

only run passport migrate

```
php artisan migrate --path=vendor/laravel/passport/database/migrations
```

Lastly generate the keys using

```
php artisan passport:install
```
